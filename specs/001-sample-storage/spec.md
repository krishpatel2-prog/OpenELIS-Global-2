# Feature Specification: Sample Storage Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-sample-storage`  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Figma Design**: [Sample Storage Dashboard](https://www.figma.com/design/4NkWdQf5VoIbJiiEb9EJMg/SSR?node-id=12-3&m=dev)

## Executive Summary

OpenELIS Global laboratories currently have **NO physical storage location tracking** for biological samples (blood, serum, tissue, etc.). This causes:

- **Sample loss**: 2-5 samples per month cannot be located
- **Retrieval delays**: Lab technicians spend 15-30 minutes searching for samples
- **Audit failures**: Cannot prove chain-of-custody for stored samples (SLIPTA/ISO accreditation requirement)
- **No capacity visibility**: Cannot monitor freezer/refrigerator utilization

This feature introduces a **5-level storage hierarchy** (Room → Device → Shelf → Rack → Position) with multi-mode location assignment (cascading dropdowns, type-ahead search, barcode scanning), sample movement tracking, and compliance-ready disposal workflows.

**Target Users**: Reception clerks, lab technicians, quality managers, lab managers

**Expected Impact**:
- Reduce sample retrieval time from 15-30 minutes to <2 minutes
- Eliminate sample loss due to unknown location
- Achieve 95% SLIPTA compliance for storage documentation
- Enable data-driven storage capacity planning

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-30

- Q: For this POC, what type of success criteria should we prioritize? → A: Feature-complete workflows (can assign, search, move, dispose samples; dashboard displays data) with basic correctness validation
- Q: Which user stories are essential for the POC to demonstrate viability? → A: P1 + P2A + P2B (Assignment + Search + Movement) - Complete tracking workflow demonstrating core value
- Q: What performance expectations should guide the POC implementation? → A: Reasonable response times without specific optimization (features work smoothly in typical usage, no need for performance tuning or caching)
- Q: What level of testing is appropriate for this POC? → A: Standard test coverage per constitution (unit + integration + E2E, >70% coverage target as specified)
- Q: Should FHIR integration be included in the POC scope? → A: Full FHIR integration per constitution (map entities to FHIR Location resources, sync to FHIR server, support IHE mCSD queries)

## POC Scope

**In Scope for POC**:
- ✅ **User Story 1 (P1)**: Basic Storage Assignment - All three assignment methods (cascading dropdowns, type-ahead search, barcode scan)
- ✅ **User Story 2A (P2)**: Sample Search and Retrieval - Search by sample ID, filter by location, display hierarchical paths
- ✅ **User Story 2B (P2)**: Sample Movement - Single and bulk sample movement with audit trail

**Deferred to Post-POC**:
- ⏸️ **User Story 3 (P3)**: Sample Disposal with Compliance - Disposal workflow, reason/method tracking, audit records
- ⏸️ **User Story 4 (P4)**: Storage Dashboard and Capacity Monitoring - Full dashboard with metrics cards, tabs, occupancy visualization, drill-down navigation

**Rationale**: POC focuses on demonstrating the core value proposition - eliminating sample loss and retrieval delays through location tracking. The assign-search-move workflow proves the concept is viable. Disposal and dashboard features validate compliance and management needs but can be added once core tracking is proven.

**Performance Expectations for POC**: Features should work smoothly in typical usage with reasonable response times (a few seconds for searches/saves). No specific performance optimization, caching, or load testing required for POC. Performance tuning can be addressed in production iterations if concept proves viable.

**Testing Expectations for POC**: Maintain standard OpenELIS test coverage requirements (unit + integration + E2E tests, >70% coverage goal) even for POC scope. This ensures quality and makes evolution to production code smoother.

**FHIR Integration for POC**: Full FHIR integration per OpenELIS constitution. Storage entities (Room, Device, Shelf, Rack, Position) will map to FHIR Location resources and sync to the FHIR server. Sample-to-location links will use Specimen.container references. This validates the architectural pattern works for storage entities and ensures external interoperability from the start.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Basic Storage Assignment (Priority: P1 - MVP)

**Actor**: Maria, a reception clerk receiving blood samples

**User Journey**:

Maria receives a blood sample for HIV viral load testing. After completing standard sample accessioning, she needs to record where the sample will be stored.

1. Maria completes sample entry in the existing Sample Patient Entry workflow (sample ID: S-2025-001, patient info, test orders)
2. In the **Storage Location selector widget** (new), she chooses ONE of three assignment methods:
   - **Option A - Cascading dropdowns**: Selects Room ("Main Laboratory") → Device ("Freezer Unit 1") → Shelf ("Shelf-A") → Rack ("Rack R1") → Position ("A5")
   - **Option B - Barcode scan**: Scans pre-printed rack label → system auto-fills "Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1" → she enters position "A5"
   - **Option C - Type-ahead search**: Types "Freezer Unit 1" → selects from filtered results → continues selecting child levels
3. System displays selected path: `Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1 > Position A5`
4. System validates:
   - Position A5 is not already occupied
   - Freezer Unit 1 is active (not decommissioned)
   - Displays warning if freezer at 80%, 90%, or 100% capacity (assignment still allowed)
5. Maria clicks Save → location recorded with her user ID and timestamp

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - without the ability to assign storage locations, no other workflows can function. This delivers immediate value by starting to build the location database.

**Independent Test**: Create a sample and assign it to a storage location using any of the three methods. Verify location is saved correctly with user ID and timestamp. This standalone capability provides value even before search/retrieval features exist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Maria has completed sample accessioning for sample S-2025-001, **When** she selects storage location "Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1 > Position A5" using cascading dropdowns and clicks Save, **Then** system records location with her user ID and current timestamp
2. **Given** position A5 in Rack R1 is already occupied by sample S-2025-002, **When** Maria attempts to assign S-2025-001 to the same position, **Then** system displays error "Position A5 is already occupied by sample S-2025-002" and prevents assignment
3. **Given** Freezer Unit 1 is marked as inactive/decommissioned, **When** Maria attempts to assign a sample to any location within it, **Then** system displays error "Cannot assign to inactive location" and suggests active alternatives
4. **Given** Maria scans a rack barcode "MAIN-FRZ01-SHA-RKR1", **When** barcode scan completes, **Then** system auto-populates Room="Main Laboratory", Device="Freezer Unit 1", Shelf="Shelf-A", Rack="Rack R1" and focuses the Position field
5. **Given** Maria has selected a location, **When** she leaves the Position field blank, **Then** system allows rack-level assignment (position optional for shelf/rack-level storage)

### User Story 2A - Sample Retrieval and Search (Priority: P2)

**Actor**: David, a lab technician preparing to run HIV viral load tests

**User Journey**:

David needs to retrieve sample S-2025-001 from storage to perform viral load testing.

1. David opens the Storage Dashboard
2. He uses the search bar and types "S-2025-001"
3. Table filters to show matching sample with full details:
   - Sample ID: S-2025-001
   - Type: Blood Serum
   - Status: Active
   - Location: `Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1 > Position A5`
   - Assigned By: Maria Lopez
   - Date: 2025-01-15 14:32
4. David notes the exact freezer/rack/position from the display
5. He physically retrieves the sample from Freezer Unit 1, Shelf A, Rack R1, Position A5
6. Retrieval time: <2 minutes (down from 15-30 minutes manual searching)

**Alternative Flow - Location-based search**:

David knows he needs samples from "Freezer Unit 1" but doesn't have specific sample IDs:
1. Opens Storage Dashboard, switches to Samples tab
2. Filters by Location: Device="Freezer Unit 1"
3. Views all samples currently in that freezer
4. Uses additional filters (Date Range="Last 7 days", Status="Active") to narrow results

**Why this priority**: Search and retrieval is the primary user pain point (15-30 minute delays). Once samples have assigned locations (P1), this capability immediately reduces retrieval time and frustration.

**Independent Test**: Assign several samples to different locations. Search for a specific sample ID and verify the location displays correctly. Physically retrieve using the displayed location path. Measure time from search to retrieval (<2 minutes target).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sample S-2025-001 is stored at "Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1 > Position A5", **When** David searches for "S-2025-001" in the dashboard search bar, **Then** system returns the sample with full location details in <2 seconds
2. **Given** 50 samples are stored in Freezer Unit 1, **When** David filters by Device="Freezer Unit 1", **Then** system displays all 50 samples with their specific positions in <2 seconds
3. **Given** David filters by Date Range="Last 7 days" AND Status="Active", **When** results are displayed, **Then** system shows only samples matching both criteria (AND logic)
4. **Given** 100,000+ samples exist in the system, **When** David performs any search/filter operation, **Then** results appear in <2 seconds
5. **Given** David has applied multiple filters, **When** he clicks "Clear Filters", **Then** system resets to show all samples

---

### User Story 2B - Sample Movement Between Locations (Priority: P2)

**Actor**: David, a lab technician preparing samples for testing

**User Journey**:

David needs to move sample S-2025-001 from the -80°C freezer to a 4°C refrigerator for viral load testing preparation.

1. From the Storage Dashboard (Samples tab) or Sample Detail view, David finds sample S-2025-001
2. He clicks the Actions overflow menu (⋮) → selects "Move"
3. Move dialog opens showing:
   - **Current location**: `Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1 > Position A5`
   - **Target location selector**: Same widget as assignment (cascading dropdowns / autocomplete / barcode scan)
4. David selects new location: `Main Laboratory > Refrigerator 2 > Shelf-1 > Rack R3 > Position C8`
5. Optionally enters reason: "Temporary storage for viral load testing"
6. System validates:
   - Target position C8 is currently empty (not occupied)
   - Refrigerator 2 is active (not decommissioned)
   - Rack R3 has available capacity
7. David clicks "Move" → System:
   - Updates sample's current location to `Refrigerator 2 > Shelf-1 > Rack R3 > Position C8`
   - Frees previous position A5 in Rack R1 (now available for other samples)
   - Records audit trail: Previous location, New location, User (David), Timestamp, Reason
8. Dashboard immediately reflects sample under Refrigerator 2

**Bulk Move Scenario**:

David needs to move 5 samples together from Freezer Unit 1 to Refrigerator 2:
1. Selects 5 samples in the dashboard
2. Clicks Actions → "Bulk Move"
3. Selects target parent location: `Main Laboratory > Refrigerator 2 > Shelf-1 > Rack R3`
4. System auto-assigns sequential available positions (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) and displays preview
5. David can optionally modify any position assignments before confirming
6. Clicks "Confirm Move" → Each sample receives individual audit record

**Why this priority**: Sample movement is a daily activity (samples move between temperature zones for testing). Combined with P2A (search), this creates a complete locate-and-move workflow that addresses the core operational pain point.

**Independent Test**: Assign a sample to one location, then move it to a different location. Verify audit trail records the movement with previous location, new location, user, timestamp, and reason. Verify dashboard updates immediately. Verify previous position is freed for reuse.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sample S-2025-001 is at position A5 in Rack R1, **When** David moves it to position C8 in Rack R3 with reason "Testing preparation", **Then** system updates current location, frees position A5, creates audit record with all details
2. **Given** target position C8 is already occupied by sample S-2025-003, **When** David attempts to move S-2025-001 there, **Then** system displays error "Position C8 is already occupied by sample S-2025-003" and prevents the move
3. **Given** Refrigerator 2 is marked inactive, **When** David attempts to move a sample there, **Then** system displays error "Cannot move to inactive location" and suggests active alternatives
4. **Given** David moves sample S-2025-001 at 14:32 on Jan 15, **When** movement completes, **Then** audit log shows: User=David, Timestamp=2025-01-15 14:32, Previous=Rack R1/A5, New=Rack R3/C8, Reason=Testing preparation
5. **Given** David selects 5 samples for bulk move to Rack R3, **When** bulk move completes, **Then** system auto-assigns sequential positions (A1-A5), David can modify any before confirming, and each sample receives individual audit record

---

### User Story 3 - Sample Disposal with Compliance (Priority: P3)

**Actor**: Sarah, a quality manager conducting quarterly sample disposal

**User Journey**:

Sarah needs to dispose of expired TB sputum samples following regulatory protocols.

1. Sarah opens Storage Dashboard, switches to Samples tab
2. Filters to show expired samples: Status="Active" + Custom Filter="Expiration Date < Today"
3. Reviews list of 15 expired TB sputum samples
4. Selects all 15 samples for disposal (single or bulk selection)
5. Clicks Actions → "Dispose"
6. Disposal dialog requires:
   - **Reason** (dropdown): Expired, Contaminated, Patient Request, Testing Complete, Other
   - **Method** (dropdown): Biohazard Autoclave, Chemical Neutralization, Incineration, Other
   - **Date/Time**: Defaults to current, editable for backdating
   - **Authorization**: System checks Sarah has "Dispose Samples" permission
   - **Notes** (optional): "Quarterly disposal Q1 2025 - TB sputum samples expired >6 months"
   - **Attachment** (optional): Upload disposal certificate PDF
7. Sarah confirms disposal → System:
   - Sets sample status to "Disposed" (irreversible)
   - Clears current location (positions freed in all 15 racks)
   - Creates immutable audit record for each sample with all disposal details
   - Prevents future assignment of disposed samples
8. Disposed samples remain viewable for audit purposes but cannot be moved or re-assigned

**Why this priority**: While less frequent than daily retrieval/movement, disposal is critical for regulatory compliance (SLIPTA accreditation). It builds on P1 and P2 by providing the complete lifecycle: assign → move → dispose.

**Independent Test**: Mark samples as expired, dispose them using the disposal workflow with reason/method/authorization. Verify samples are marked "Disposed", positions are freed, audit records are immutable, and disposed samples cannot be reassigned. Export disposal records to verify compliance documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Sarah has "Dispose Samples" permission and selects 15 expired samples, **When** she completes disposal with Reason="Expired" and Method="Biohazard Autoclave", **Then** all 15 samples are marked "Disposed", their positions are freed, and immutable audit records are created
2. **Given** David (lab technician) without disposal permission attempts disposal, **When** he clicks "Dispose", **Then** system displays "Unauthorized: You do not have permission to dispose samples"
3. **Given** Sarah disposes sample S-2025-001 on Jan 15 at 16:00, **When** she views the audit log, **Then** log shows: User=Sarah, Timestamp=2025-01-15 16:00, Status=Disposed, Reason=Expired, Method=Biohazard Autoclave, Notes=[text], Attachment=[PDF link]
4. **Given** sample S-2025-001 is disposed, **When** David attempts to assign it to a new location, **Then** system prevents assignment with error "Cannot assign disposed sample"
5. **Given** sample S-2025-001 was at position A5 before disposal, **When** disposal completes, **Then** position A5 becomes available for new sample assignment

### User Story 4 - Storage Dashboard and Capacity Monitoring (Priority: P3)

**Actor**: Dr. Johnson, a lab manager monitoring storage utilization

**User Journey**:

Dr. Johnson needs to monitor freezer capacity across the laboratory to plan procurement of additional storage equipment.

1. Dr. Johnson opens the Storage Dashboard
2. Views **metric cards** at the top:
   - **Total Samples**: 2,847 (count of all samples with assigned locations)
   - **Active**: 2,654 (currently stored and available)
   - **Disposed**: 193 (disposed samples, for record-keeping)
   - **Storage Locations**: 12 rooms (or total capacity count)
3. Switches between **5 tabs** to view different hierarchy levels:

   **Rooms Tab**:
   - Shows: Name | Code | Devices (count) | Samples (count) | Status | Actions
   - Example row: "Main Laboratory" | MAIN | 8 devices | 1,234 samples | Active | [⋮]

   **Devices Tab**:
   - Shows: Name | Code | Room | Type (badge) | Occupancy | Status | Actions
   - Example row: "Freezer Unit 1" | FRZ01 | Main Laboratory | [freezer] | 287/500 (57%) [progress bar] | Active | [⋮]
   - Type badges: "freezer", "fridge", "cabinet" (visual indicators)

   **Shelves Tab**:
   - Shows: Label | Device | Room | Occupancy | Status | Actions
   - Example row: "Shelf-A" | Freezer Unit 1 | Main Laboratory | 23/81 (28%) [progress bar] | Active | [⋮]

   **Racks Tab**:
   - Shows: Label | Shelf | Device | Dimensions | Occupancy | Status | Actions
   - Example row: "Rack R1" | Shelf-A | Freezer Unit 1 | 9 × 9 | 23/81 (28%) [progress bar] | Active | [⋮]

   **Samples Tab**:
   - Shows: Sample ID | Type | Status | Location (hierarchical path) | Assigned By | Date | Actions
   - Example row: S-2025-001 | Blood Serum | Active | Main Laboratory > Freezer Unit 1 > Shelf-A > Rack R1 > Pos A5 | Maria Lopez | 2025-01-15 14:32 | [⋮]

4. Uses **occupancy display pattern** to identify capacity issues:
   - Fraction (occupied/total): "287/500"
   - Percentage: "57%"
   - Visual progress bar: Shows 57% filled
   - Color coding (optional): Green (<70%), Yellow (70-90%), Red (>90%)

5. Uses **filters** to analyze specific areas:
   - Filter: Room="Main Laboratory" + Device Type="freezer" → Shows all freezers in main lab
   - Filter: Occupancy >80% → Identifies near-capacity devices

6. **Drill-down navigation**:
   - Clicks "Freezer Unit 1" name → Switches to Shelves tab, filtered to show only shelves in Freezer Unit 1
   - Clicks "Shelf-A" name → Switches to Racks tab, filtered to Shelf-A
   - Clicks "Rack R1" name → Switches to Samples tab, filtered to Rack R1 (or optionally shows grid view)

7. Clicks **Export** button → Downloads filtered data as CSV with all metadata for capacity planning report

8. Dr. Johnson identifies that Freezer Unit 1 is at 94% capacity and Refrigerator 3 is at 87% capacity. He initiates procurement for additional freezer.

**Why this priority**: Dashboard and capacity monitoring enable proactive management and data-driven decisions. It's less urgent than daily operations (P1-P2) but critical for long-term efficiency and preventing storage overflow.

**Independent Test**: Create storage hierarchy (rooms, devices, shelves, racks), assign samples to various locations. Navigate between tabs, verify occupancy calculations are correct (occupied/total = percentage), use drill-down navigation, apply filters, and export data to CSV. Verify metrics update when samples are assigned/moved/disposed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 2,847 samples are assigned to storage locations (2,654 active, 193 disposed), **When** Dr. Johnson opens the dashboard, **Then** metric cards display correct counts
2. **Given** Freezer Unit 1 has 287 samples assigned out of 500 total capacity, **When** Dr. Johnson views the Devices tab, **Then** occupancy shows "287/500 (57%)" with proportional progress bar
3. **Given** Dr. Johnson is viewing the Devices tab, **When** he clicks "Freezer Unit 1" name, **Then** system switches to Shelves tab filtered to show only shelves within Freezer Unit 1
4. **Given** Dr. Johnson has applied filter "Occupancy >80%", **When** results display, **Then** only devices/shelves/racks with >80% occupancy are shown
5. **Given** Dr. Johnson clicks Export with active filters, **When** export completes, **Then** CSV file contains only filtered data with all table columns plus metadata (within 10 seconds for 10,000 records)
6. **Given** Maria assigns a new sample to Freezer Unit 1, **When** Dr. Johnson refreshes the dashboard, **Then** Freezer Unit 1 occupancy increments immediately (288/500, 58%)

---

### Edge Cases

- **Concurrent access conflict**: Two reception clerks simultaneously assign different samples to the same position A5 in Rack R1. Second clerk receives error "Position A5 was just occupied by sample S-2025-XXX. Please select another position."

- **Barcode disambiguation**: Lab has two racks with identical labels "R1" in different devices. Scanning barcode "MAIN-FRZ01-SHA-R1" vs "MAIN-FRZ02-SHB-R1" resolves to distinct racks. If barcode format is ambiguous, system shows disambiguation dialog.

- **Deactivating location with active samples**: Admin attempts to deactivate Freezer Unit 1 while 287 samples are stored there. System displays warning: "Cannot deactivate location with 287 active samples. Move or dispose samples first, or deactivate to prevent NEW assignments only."

- **Deleting parent location cascade**: Admin attempts to delete Device "Freezer Unit 1" which has 5 child shelves. System prevents deletion with error: "Cannot delete location with child locations. Delete or deactivate child shelves first."

- **Disposed sample movement attempt**: Technician accidentally attempts to move a disposed sample. System prevents action with error: "Cannot move disposed sample S-2025-001."

- **Position schema flexibility**: Lab A uses alphanumeric positions (A1, B2), Lab B uses numeric (1-1, 2-5), Lab C uses color-coded (RED-01, BLUE-03). System accepts all as free text without validation.

- **Shelf/rack-level assignment without position**: Lab uses large baskets on shelves (no fixed positions). Reception clerk assigns sample to "Shelf-A" without specifying position. System allows blank position field.

- **Capacity threshold warnings**: Rack R1 is configured with 81 total positions. System shows warnings at 80% (65th sample), 90% (73rd sample), and 100% (81st sample) capacity with message "Rack R1 is [percentage]% full. Consider using alternative storage." Assignment always allowed (no hard block, even at 100%+).

- **Bulk move with insufficient capacity**: User selects 20 samples to bulk move to Rack R3 which has only 15 available positions. System displays error: "Target rack has only 15 available positions, but 20 samples selected. Reduce selection or choose different target."

- **Audit log retention**: System retains disposal audit logs for 7+ years. After 7 years, logs remain immutable but may be archived to cold storage (not deleted).

- **Barcode generation offline**: Network is down. User generates barcode labels for new racks. System queues labels for printing and syncs barcode registry when network restored.

- **Search performance with 100,000+ samples**: Dashboard search bar query "S-2025" matches 50,000 samples. System paginates results and displays first 100 in <2 seconds. User can page through or narrow search.

- **Export large dataset**: User exports all 100,000 samples to CSV. System processes export in background and provides download link when complete (within reasonable time, <1 minute for 100k records).

## Requirements

- **Assumption 10**: Position text field max length 50 characters is sufficient for all naming conventions observed in field research

## Success Criteria

### POC Functional Completion Criteria

**Note**: This is a Proof-of-Concept implementation. Success criteria focus on functional completeness and correctness validation for the core tracking workflow (assign-search-move). Disposal and dashboard features are deferred to post-POC iterations.

**In-Scope for POC (User Stories P1, P2A, P2B)**:

- **SC-001**: **Storage Assignment Workflow** - User can assign a sample to a storage location using any of three methods (cascading dropdowns, type-ahead search, barcode scan), and assignment is saved with correct location path, user ID, and timestamp

- **SC-002**: **Sample Search and Retrieval** - User can search for a sample by ID and system displays the complete hierarchical storage location path (Room > Device > Shelf > Rack > Position)

- **SC-003**: **Sample Movement** - User can move a sample from one storage location to another, previous location is freed, new location is recorded, and audit trail captures the movement with user, timestamp, and reason

- **SC-004**: **Bulk Movement** - User can select multiple samples and move them together, system auto-assigns sequential positions with option to modify, and each sample receives individual audit record

- **SC-005**: **Location Hierarchy Management** - User can create storage locations inline (Room, Device, Shelf, Rack) during assignment workflow, and new locations appear immediately in selector without page refresh

- **SC-006**: **Data Integrity** - Concurrent assignment attempts to the same position are handled correctly (second user receives error)

- **SC-007**: **Audit Trail Completeness** - All storage actions (assign, move) are recorded in audit log with user ID, timestamp, action type, previous state, new state, and optional reason

- **SC-008**: **FHIR Integration** - Storage entities (Room, Device, Shelf, Rack, Position) are mapped to FHIR Location resources and synced to the FHIR server, and sample-to-location links use Specimen.container references

**Deferred to Post-POC** (User Stories P3, P4):

- **SC-FUTURE-001**: Sample Disposal - Disposal workflow with reason/method tracking and immutable audit records
- **SC-FUTURE-002**: Storage Dashboard - Metrics cards and 5-tab navigation with data tables
- **SC-FUTURE-003**: Occupancy Calculation - Visual occupancy display (fraction, percentage, progress bar)
- **SC-FUTURE-004**: Disposed Sample Prevention - System prevents reassignment of disposed samples

- Automated temperature monitoring/alerts (requires IoT sensor integration)
- RFID tag support (barcode-only for now)
- Predictive analytics for sample expiration forecasting
- Mobile native app for barcode scanning (web-based sufficient for MVP)
- Integration with external freezer management systems (e.g., Thermo Fisher FreezerWorks)

- Real-time location tracking (GPS/RFID for chain-of-custody in transit)
- Automated inventory replenishment recommendations
- Visual heatmaps of storage utilization by temperature zone
- Advanced reporting dashboards (BI/analytics beyond CSV export)
- Configurable capacity thresholds per device/rack (MVP uses fixed 80%, 90%, 100%)
